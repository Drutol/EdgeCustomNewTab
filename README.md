# MyEdgeStartPage

So... I wanted to give Edge a go, but the default start page is hideous and there's literally now way to customize it out of the box. After a bit of googling I mixed two projects:

* Breeze Edge extension (no repo)
* Eva's [Iro startpage](https://github.com/ewasion/iro)

Whenever new tab is opened it gets updated with new content, that's about it.
